# ECAsT
Expanded-CAsT: A multi-turn conversation paraphrase dataset.

Expanded-CAsT (ECAsT) is a multi-turn paraphrase dataset built using TREC CAsT conversations. There are currently very few datasets available for training and evaluating conversational search systems, and ECAsT aims to address this limitation by augmenting the original dataset with paraphrased turns.

ECAsT is built using the first three years of CAsT releases (2019, 2020, and 2021). The dataset expands the size of the original CAsT collection by over 665\%, resulting in a total of 9,214 turns across 131 open-domain topics. This substantial increase in data volume can significantly benefit the development and evaluation of conversational search systems.
